# Google-Landmark-Recognition

Description : Did you ever go through your vacation photos and ask yourself: What is the name of this temple I visited in China? Who created this monument I saw in France? Landmark recognition can help! This technology can predict landmark labels directly from image pixels, to help people better understand and organize their photo collections.

Today, a great obstacle to landmark recognition research is the lack of large annotated datasets. Here we present the largest worldwide dataset to date, to foster progress in this problem. This Project challenges to build models that recognize the correct landmark (if any) in a dataset of challenging test images.
